# FileSplitter
A handy script to split large files into smaller ones.

Give the script the file path for the large file, and then provide filename and extension for the smaller files you want. 

Adjust the number of lines you want in each of the smaller files. 


This script is especially useful for .txt, .csv and .jsonl files
